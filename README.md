# The purpose of this project is to read a type K thermocouple using a MAX31856 interface board and to publish the temperature via MQTT to Node-Red which is running on a Rasberry pi. The thermocouple device is connected to an ESP32 running micropython which read the temps via the Max31856 using an SPI type interface. Node-Red is a project that makes it easy to interface with devices via local wifi and to easily create web pages with buttons, charts and other functions to interact with devices connected to it via wifi.
